## **<u>*About Me*</u>**

**I am a tech lover, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Mechatronics at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I got inspired to Engineering when I was 16 years old and since then I started playing around with PCB's and boards. I am a Tech Enthusiast who is a tireless seeker of knowledge and wisdom. My primary field of interest is Machine Learning and followed by Cyber Security and IoT. Nothing fascinates me more than the words of Elon Musk "Good Ideas are always crazy until they're not". I am a quick learner and my passion for technology never quenches. I am a quick learner and I have fun teaching other people. I am a strong believer in STEM learning. I aspire to become part of a leading technical company.**
